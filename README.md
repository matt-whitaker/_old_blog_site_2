A minimalist blog generated with Hexo.js

## Development

At the moment, not a great process.

1. In one terminal, run ```sudo npm run server```
2. In another, when you have made changes, run ```npm run generate```

## To Do
1. Responsiveness - define thresholds for desktop, tablet, and mobile
2. Images - sizes for desktop, tablet, and, mobile
3. Images - pick for pages, line up some for posts
